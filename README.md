# Graph Shortest Path Optimization Application

### Project for the Software Development for Information Problems course 2016-2017 (Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens) -  ACM SIGMOD 2016 contest.

Implemented an application, based on certain algorithms and data structures, for the calculation of shortest paths in graphs consisted of millions of edges in the smallest amount of time possible.  

Separate calculation methods for static and dynamic graphs.  
Multithreaded program using POSIX threads.
